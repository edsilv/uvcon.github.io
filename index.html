    <h1>UVCON</h1>
    
    <p>UVCON is held at the V&A as part of the V&A Research Institute (VARI), a five-year programme of research projects and partnerships supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. It takes the V&A's pioneering research culture into a new phase that allows the Museum to experiment with new ways of studying, displaying and accessibly storing its collections. VARI will give better access to the V&A's objects and join its experts with academic scholars, practicing artists, designers and makers and members of the general public.</p>
    <p>Universal Viewer will be particularly used by two VARI projects:,</p>
